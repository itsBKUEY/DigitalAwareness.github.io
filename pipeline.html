            <h2>How we enter the Pipeline</h2>
        
              <p> The initial exposure to the community plays an essential role in welcoming new members within the community. In the case of the Red Pill, its entry points are discussions of career success, fitness, and dating strategies (Valkenburgh and Shawn). After all, who would object to wanting a better job, a healthier body, and more luck with the ladies? It’s what makes this so incredibly effective, the universal appeal and the activity’s traditional positive view in society. These discussions gradually introduce members to more extreme content and ideologies under the guise of self-improvement. Career advice turns to thoughts on workplace hierarchies. Fitness discussions start emphasizing the ‘masculine ideals’. Dating advice turns into thoughts on gender relations. Slowly as engagement deepens within the Red Pill, its members encounter what researchers term the "explanatory dimension" (Ylikoski et al) of Red Pill ideology. This lays down the frameworks for understanding their personal struggles, outlining why and who to blame within society. Blending evolutionary psychology with economic theories and real tangible data all to create and prove their own narratives about social dynamics (Valkenburgh and Shawn). Individuals who adopt these explanatory frameworks are more likely to remain engaged with the community long-term.</p>
