              <p> One solution lies in making the big tech companies more accountable for content moderation and the effects of their algorithm. Research by Alghowinem et al. has shown potential in AI depression detection systems. These systems could spot people falling into dangerous thought patterns early on before the algorithms push them deeper. Implementation of these types of systems could possibly be a solution to this growing crisis. The caveats to this approach would however be the potential privacy violations and inadvertent suppression of political discourse.</p>

                <img src="assets/sol.jpg" alt="Digital Disconnection Visualization">
                <div class="img-caption">The growing isolation in our connected world</div>
            </div>
              <p> Another idea is the creation of a new social media platform. Instead of being like the old and expanding on the problems of social media, it would emphasize real-world interaction and creating community. Rewarding users for offline meetings and real interactions with their local communities isn't just a feature - it's the whole point. Limiting the time users can scroll through feeds and having a design philosophy of truly bringing people together. This may be criticized as just creating more social media however with the power of proper thought and care being put into people's well-being instead of their engagement this idea should yield a different outcome than the state of current social media.</p>

            <h2>solutions 3 </h2>
            <div class="img-wrapper" id ="imgsmall">
                <img src="assets/Blue1.jpg" alt="Digital Disconnection Visualization">
                <div class="img-caption">The growing isolation in our connected world</div>
            </div>
              <p>The most intriguing possibility would be a mixture of the two. A reforming of the current social media apps to put emphasis on people instead of profit. Transparent algorithms, mental health detection AI, simply auditing their recommendations - these aren't new ideas. The challenge isn't finding ways to fix the problem but adding public pressure to overcome the current profit-driven resistance to change. Success will require the collaboration of policymakers, tech developers, mental health specialists, and citizens to reshape the online space into a better place.  </p>
